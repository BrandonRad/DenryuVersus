Jack Thunderdome :USA:

Real name Randall Kennedy, Jack had reached rank of Captain when he was only 18 years old. However, despite multiple offers for promotion, he refused to accept them, believing that piloting was the most important thing in his life. Despite becoming incredibly decorated throughout his countless years of service, he continued to maintain his rank as Captain to fly, only stopping to teach others what it meant to fly. When the Mushi invaded, all of the American Alliance turned to one man for that glimmer of hope that they needed.

Raiden Denryu :JPN:

Son of the professor who proposed the Denryu Versus program, Raiden was trained at a very young age to become the perfect pilot. Calculated and strong-willed, Raiden would go on to ace every test and every simulation that was given to him at the age of 16. Two years later, he would finally live up to his father's hopes and get into the pilot's seat to combat the Mushi. Although the Japanese Alliance was originally against the idea of Professor Denryu using his own son as their representative, his skill and prowess was hard to deny in their time of need.
